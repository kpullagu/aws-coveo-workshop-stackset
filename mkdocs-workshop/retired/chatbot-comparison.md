**Patterns**: All Three Backends (Coveo Direct API, Bedrock Agent, AgentCore Runtime + MCP)  
**Duration**: 20 minutes  
**Objective**: Test multi-turn conversations across all three backends and explore conversational AI for case deflection.

!!! note "Throughput Notice"
    If Bedrock doesn't respond immediately, wait 30-60 seconds and retry. This is normal during peak workshop usage.

## 🎯 Lab Goals

By the end of this lab, you will:

- ✅ Test multi-turn conversations across all three backends
- ✅ Compare single-turn vs multi-turn capabilities
- ✅ Explore session memory and cross-session memory
- ✅ Understand case deflection use cases
- ✅ Identify which backend fits different scenarios

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

In this lab, you'll test the **Chatbot Interface** with all three backends:

1. **Go to Workshop UI**
2. **Click the Chat icon** (bottom right)

**Workshop UI - Chat Icon Location**

![Workshop UI - Chat Icon Location](../images/ChatPanel.png)

3. **Chat panel opens**

<div class="screenshot-placeholder">
Workshop UI - Chat Panel Open
</div>

**Step 2: Select Coveo Backend**

1. **Ensure backend is set to "Coveo"**
2. **Observe**: Chat interface with Coveo backend

**Step 3: Test Single-Turn Behavior**

**Turn 1: Basic Question**
```
I found errors in my credit report, what’s first?
```

**Expected**: Conversational response with source citations

---

**Turn 2: Multi-part Question**
```
What were we discussing earlier
```
**Expected**: The chatbot doesn't recollect anything, since answer API is single turn

**Chat interface with Coveo backend single turn**

![Chat interface with Coveo backend single turn response ](../images/ChatPanel-coveo-singleturn.png)

---

**Observation**:

- ❌ No memory of previous question
- ❌ Each turn is independent
- ✅ Fast responses
- ✅ Good for FAQ-style questions

---

### Exercise 4.2: Test Multi-Turn with Bedrock Agent (7 minutes)

**Objective**: Test Bedrock Agent backend with session memory.

**Step 1: Refresh browser to start a new session and then Switch to Bedrock Agent**

**Change backend to "Bedrock Agent"** Open chat interface

**Chat interface with Bedrock Agent backend**

![Chat interface with Bebrock Agent backend](../images/ChatPanel-bedrockagent.png)


**Step 2: Make a note of the Bedrock Agent Session ID**

**Chat interface with Bedrock Agent backend session ID**

![Chat interface with Bebrock Agent backend session ID](../images/ChatPanel-bedrockagent-1.png)


**Step 3: Test Credit Remediation Scenario**

**Turn 1: Basic Question**
```
I found errors in my credit report, what’s first?
```

**Expected**: Conversational response with source citations

---

**Turn 2: Multi-part Question**
```
What were we discussing earlier
```

---

**Refresh browser now to start a new session. Ensure Bedrock Agent is selected**

Notice the same session ID (compare with the one you noted earlier)

!!! info "Session ID local storage"
    - The solution is designed to store the session ID in local storage, and so upon refresh of the browser, the existing session ID is maintained


**Turn 4: followup Question**
```
What were we discussing earlier
```
**Expected**: Previous context recollection (same session)

---

**Browser Refresh Chat recollection with Bedrock Agent**

![Browser Refresh Chat recollection with Bedrock Agent](../images/ChatPanel-bedrockagent-3.png)


**Turn 5: followup Question**
```
Any dispute follow-up timing guidance?
```
**Expected**: Previous context recollection and presenting a response aligned to the credit report issues

---

**Context recollection with Bedrock Agent**

![Context recollection with Bedrock Agent](../images/ChatPanel-bedrockagent-4.png)

---

**Observation**:

- ✅ Remembers conversation context in a session and across sessions
- ✅ Understands follow-up questions
- ✅ Maintains topic continuity
- ✅ Natural conversation flow

---

**Multi Turn Conversation with Agentcore MCP Agent**

![Multi Turn Conversation with Agentcore MCP Agent](../images/ChatPanel-mcp-2.png)


**Turn 3: Recollection**
```
Sorry I went to grab coffee!, What did we discuss earlier?
```

**Expected**: Previous context recollection and relevant response


**Chat recollection with Agentcore MCP Agent in same session**

![Chat recollection with Agentcore MCP Agent in same session](../images/ChatPanel-mcp-3.png)


---

**Refresh browser now and keep the same session. Ensure you switch to Coveo Hosted MCP Agent**

Notice the same session ID (compare with the one you noted earlier)

!!! info "Session ID and Actor ID"
    - The solution stores the session ID in local storage, so a browser refresh keeps the same active session.
    - Actor ID (unique value retrieved from JWT) is based on user identity and enables memory retrieval across different sessions after the previous session ends or times out.


**Turn 4: followup Question**
```
What were we discussing earlier
```
**Expected**: Previous context recollection (same session)

---

**Browser Refresh Chat recollection with Agentcore MCP Agent**

![Browser Refresh Chat recollection with Agentcore MCP Agent](../images/ChatPanel-mcp-4.png)


**Turn 5: followup Question**
```
for tax efficient growth what do you recommend?
```
**Expected**: Previous context recollection and presenting a response aligned to the retirement

---

**Context recollection with Agentcore MCP Agent**

![Context recollection with Agentcore MCP Agent](../images/ChatPanel-mcp-5.png)


**Now to test a fresh session, click End Chat & Save Memory**. Select Coveo Hosted MCP Agent as the backend and open the chatbot again.

!!! info "Session ID changes now"
    For cross-sessions, the session ID changes

**New session with Agentcore MCP Agent**

![New Session with Agentcore MCP Agent](../images/ChatPanel-mcp-6.png)


**Turn 6: followup Question**
```
What did we discuss in the past?
```
**Expected**: Previous context recollection with a summary of all prior conversations

**Multi Turn Conversation across sessions with Agentcore MCP Agent**

![Multi Turn Conversation across sessions with Agentcore MCP Agent](../images/ChatPanel-mcp-7.png)

---

**Observation**:

- ✅ Remembers conversation context within a session and can recall prior sessions for the same user after those sessions have been summarized
- ✅ Understands follow-up questions
- ✅ Maintains topic continuity
- ✅ Natural conversation flow

!!! info "Session Memory"
    Coveo Hosted MCP Agent maintains same-session context and cross-session recall by using AgentCore memory with a stable user identity and a separate session ID.
